## 1. Introduction
This project is initiated by H&M as a Kaggle challenge to provide product recommendations based on previous purchases. For this challenge, we are given the purchase history of customers across time, along with supporting customer and product metadata. Our goal is to predict what articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data end date.
