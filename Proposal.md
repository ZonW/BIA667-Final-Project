## 1. Introduction
Online shopping offers shoppers an extensive selection of products to browse through. But with too many choices, customers might not quickly find what interests them or what they are looking for, and ultimately, they might not make a purchase. To enhance the shopping experience, product recommendations are key. More importantly, helping customers make the right choices also has a positive implications for sustainability, as it reduces returns, and thereby minimizes emissions from transportation. This project is initiated by H&M as a Kaggle challenge to provide product recommendations based on previous purchases. For this project, we are given the purchase history of customers across time, along with supporting customer and product metadata. Our goal is to predict what articles each customer will purchase in the 7-day period immediately after the training data end date.
